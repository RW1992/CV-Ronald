<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am Ronald, just turned 31 years old and started learning HTML as you can see on this website. I follow
  a course on Udemy for this. Before this I worked at the Intratuin in Barneveld. I've been interested in IT for a very long time,
  programming and especially I think the creative side of it. With the knowledge I now have, I think it would be nice to be Fron end developer.</p>
